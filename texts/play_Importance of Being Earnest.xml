    <stage type="setting">
      <p>Morning-room in Algernon's flat in Half-Moon Street. The room is luxuriously and artistically furnished. <sound>The sound of a piano is heard in the adjoining room.</sound></p>
    </stage>
    <stage type="business">
      <p><move who="#lane"/>Lane is arranging afternoon tea on the table, and <sound>after the music has ceased,</sound><move who="#alg" type="enter"/>Algernon enters.</p>
    </stage>

    <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
      <p>Did you hear what I was playing, Lane? </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#lane"><speaker>LANE.</speaker>
      <p>I didn't think it polite to listen, sir. </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
      <p> I'm sorry for that, for your sake. I don't play accurately—any one can play accurately—but I play with wonderful expression. As far as the piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte. I keep science for Life. </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#lane"><speaker>LANE.</speaker>
      <p> Yes, sir. </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
      <p> And, speaking of the science of Life, have you got the cucumber sandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell? </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#lane"><speaker>LANE.</speaker>
      <p> Yes, sir. <stage type="prop">[Hands them on a salver.]</stage> </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
      <p> <stage type="blocking">[Inspects them, takes two, and sits down on the sofa.]</stage> Oh! . . . by the way, Lane, I see from your book that on Thursday night, when Lord Shoreman and Mr. Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of champagne are entered as having been consumed. </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#lane"><speaker>LANE.</speaker>
      <p> Yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint. </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
      <p> Why is it that at a bachelor's establishment the servants invariably drink the champagne? I ask merely for information. </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#lane"><speaker>LANE.</speaker> <p> I attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir. I have often observed that in married households the champagne is rarely of a first-rate brand. </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
      <p> Good heavens! Is marriage so demoralising as that? </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#lane"><speaker>LANE.</speaker>
      <p> I believe it <i>is</i> a very pleasant state, sir. I have had very little experience of it myself up to the present. I have only been married once. That was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and a young person. </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
      <p><stage type="delivery">[Languidly.]</stage> I don't know that I am much interested in your family life, Lane. </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#lane"><speaker>LANE.</speaker>
      <p> No, sir; it is not a very interesting subject. I never think of it myself. </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
      <p> Very natural, I am sure. That will do, Lane, thank you. </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#lane"><speaker>LANE.</speaker>
      <p> Thank you, sir. <move who="#lane" type="exit"/>[Lane goes out.]</p> </sp>

  </div2>

  <div2 type="scene" n="2">
    <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
      <p>Lane's views on marriage seem somewhat lax. Really, if the lower orders don't set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them? They seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility. </p> </sp>

  </div2>

    <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
      <p> How are you, my dear Ernest? What brings you up to town? </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
      <p> Oh, pleasure, pleasure! What else should bring one anywhere? Eating as usual, I see, Algy! </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
      <p> <stage type="delivery">[Stiffly]</stage> I believe it is customary in good society to take some slight refreshment at five o'clock. Where have you been since last Thursday? </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
      <p> <stage type="blocking">[Sitting down on the sofa.]</stage> In the country. </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
      <p> What on earth do you do there? </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
      <p> <stage type="costume">[Pulling off his gloves.]</stage> When one is in town one amuses oneself. When one is in the country one amuses other people. It is excessively boring. </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
      <p> And who are the people you amuse? </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
      <p> <stage type="delivery">[Airily.]</stage> Oh, neighbours, neighbours. </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
      <p> Got nice neighbours in your part of Shropshire? </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
      <p> Perfectly horrid! Never speak to one of them. </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
      <p> How immensely you must amuse them! ><stage type="blocking">[Goes over and takes sandwich.]</stage> By the way, Shropshire is your county, is it not? </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
      <p> Eh? Shropshire? Yes, of course. Hallo! Why all these cups? Why cucumber sandwiches? Why such reckless extravagance in one so young? Who is coming to tea? </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
      <p> Oh! merely Aunt Augusta and Gwendolen. </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
      <p> How perfectly delightful! </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
      <p> Yes, that is all very well; but I am afraid Aunt Augusta won't quite approve of your being here. </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
      <p> May I ask why? </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
      <p> My dear fellow, the way you flirt with Gwendolen is perfectly disgraceful. It is almost as bad as the way Gwendolen flirts with you. </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
      <p> I am in love with Gwendolen. I have come up to town expressly to propose to her. </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
      <p> I thought you had come up for pleasure? . . . I call that business. </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
      <p> How utterly unromantic you are! </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
      <p> I really don't see anything romantic in proposing. It is very romantic to be in love. But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal. Why, one may be accepted. One usually is, I believe. Then the excitement is all over. The very essence of romance is uncertainty. If ever I get married, I'll certainly try to forget the fact. </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
      <p> I have no doubt about that, dear Algy. The Divorce Court was specially invented for people whose memories are so curiously constituted. </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
      <p> Oh! there is no use speculating on that subject. Divorces are made in Heaven— <stage type="blocking"><move who="#jack"/>[Jack puts out his hand to take a sandwich. <move who="#alg"/>Algernon at once interferes.] </stage> Please don't touch the cucumber sandwiches. They are ordered specially for Aunt Augusta. <move who="alg"/>[Takes one and eats it.] </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
        <p> Well, you have been eating them all the time. </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
        <p> That is quite a different  matter. She is my aunt. <stage type="business">[Takes plate from below.]</stage> Have some bread and butter. The bread and butter is for Gwendolen. Gwendolen is devoted to bread and butter. </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
        <p> <stage type="blocking">[Advancing to table and helping himself.]</stage> And very good bread and butter it is too.  </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
        <p> Well, my dear fellow, you need not eat as if you were going to eat it all. You behave as if you were married to her already. You are not married to her already, and I don't think you ever will be.  </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
        <p> Why on earth do you say that?  </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
        <p> Well, in the first place girls never marry the men they flirt with. Girls don't think it right.  </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
        <p> Oh, that is nonsense!  </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
        <p> It isn't. It is a great truth. It accounts for the extraordinary number of bachelors that one sees all over the place. In the second place, I don't give my consent.  </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
        <p> Your consent! </p> </sp>

    <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
        <p> My dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin. And before I allow you to marry her, you will have to clear up the whole question of Cecily. <stage type="prop">[Rings bell.]</stage> </p></sp>

    <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
        <p> Cecily! What on earth do you mean? What do you mean, Algy, by Cecily! I don't know any one of the name of Cecily. </p></sp>

      <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
        <p> Bring me that cigarette case Mr. Worthing left in the smoking-room the last time he dined here. </p></sp>

      <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
        <p> Do you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time? I wish to goodness you had let me know. I have been writing frantic letters to Scotland Yard about it. I was very nearly offering a large reward.</p></sp>

      <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
        <p> Well, I wish you would offer one. I happen to be more than usually hard up.</p></sp>

      <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
        <p> There is no good offering a large reward now that the thing is found.</p></sp>

    </div2>

    <div2 type="scene" n="8">
      <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
         <p> I think that is rather mean of you, Ernest, I must say. <stage type="business">[Opens case and examines it.]</stage> However, it makes no matter, for, now that I look at the inscription inside, I find that the thing isn't yours after all. </p></sp>

      <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
         <p> Of course it's mine. <stage type="blocking">[Moving to him.]</stage> You have seen me with it a hundred times, and you have no right whatsoever to read what is written inside. It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette case. </p></sp>

      <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
         <p> Oh! it is absurd to have a hard and fast rule about what one should read and what one shouldn't. More than half of modern culture depends on what one shouldn't read. </p></sp>

      <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
         <p> I am quite aware of the fact, and I don't propose to discuss modern culture. It isn't the sort of thing one should talk of in private. I simply want my cigarette case back. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
         <p> Yes; but this isn't your cigarette case. This cigarette case is a present from some one of the name of Cecily, and you said you didn't know any one of that name. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
         <p> Well, if you want to know, Cecily happens to be my aunt. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
         <p> Your aunt! </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
         <p> Yes. Charming old lady she is, too. Lives at Tunbridge Wells. Just give it back to me, Algy. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
         <p> <stage type="blocking">[Retreating to back of sofa.]</stage> But why does she call herself little Cecily if she is your aunt and lives at Tunbridge Wells? <stage type="delivery">[Reading.]</stage> 'From little Cecily with her fondest love.' </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
         <p> <stage type="blocking">[Moving to sofa and kneeling upon it.]</stage> My dear fellow, what on earth is there in that? Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall. That is a matter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for herself. You seem to think that every aunt should be exactly like your aunt! That is absurd! For Heaven's sake give me back my cigarette case. <stage type="blocking">[Follows <b>Algernon</b> round the room.]</stage> </p></sp>

       <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
         <p> Yes. But why does your aunt call you her uncle? 'From little Cecily, with her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack.' There is no objection, I admit, to an aunt being a small aunt, but why an aunt, no matter what her size may be, should call her own nephew her uncle, I can't quite make out. Besides, your name isn't Jack at all; it is Ernest. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
         <p> It isn't Ernest; it's Jack. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#alg" type="monologue"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
         <p> You have always told me it was Ernest. I have introduced you to every one as Ernest. You answer to the name of Ernest. You look as if your name was Ernest. You are the most earnest-looking person I ever saw in my life. It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn't Ernest. It's on your cards. Here is one of them. <stage type="business">[Taking it from case.]</stage> 'Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany.' I'll keep this as a proof that your name is Ernest if ever you attempt to deny it to me, or to Gwendolen, or to any one else. <stage type="prop">[Puts the card in his pocket.]</stage></p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
         <p> Well, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country, and the cigarette case was given to me in the country. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
         <p> Yes, but that does not account for the fact that your small Aunt Cecily, who lives at Tunbridge Wells, calls you her dear uncle. Come, old boy, you had much better have the thing out at once. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
         <p> My dear Algy, you talk exactly as if you were a dentist. It is very vulgar to talk like a dentist when one isn't a dentist. It produces a false impression. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
         <p> Well, that is exactly what dentists always do. Now, go on! Tell me the whole thing. I may mention that I have always suspected you of being a confirmed and secret Bunburyist; and I am quite sure of it now. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
         <p> Bunburyist? What on earth do you mean by a Bunburyist? </p></sp>

       <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
         <p> I'll reveal to you the meaning of that incomparable expression as soon as you are kind enough to inform me why you are Ernest in town and Jack in the country. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
         <p> Well, produce my cigarette case first. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
         <p> Here it is. <stage type="business">[Hands cigarette case.]</stage> Now produce your explanation, and pray make it improbable. <stage type="blocking">[Sits on sofa.]</stage> </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack" type="monologue"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
         <p> My dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about my explanation at all. In fact it's perfectly ordinary. Old Mr. Thomas Cardew, who adopted me when I was a little boy, made me in his will guardian to his grand-daughter, Miss Cecily Cardew. Cecily, who addresses me as her uncle from motives of respect that you could not possibly appreciate, lives at my place in the country under the charge of her admirable governess, Miss Prism. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
         <p> Where is that place in the country, by the way? </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
         <p> That is nothing to you, dear boy. You are not going to be invited . . . I may tell you candidly that the place is not in Shropshire. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
         <p> I suspected that, my dear fellow! I have Bunburyed all over Shropshire on two separate occasions. Now, go on. Why are you Ernest in town and Jack in the country? </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack" type="monologue"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
         <p> My dear Algy, I don't know whether you will be able to understand my real motives. You are hardly serious enough. When one is placed in the position of guardian, one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all subjects. It's one's duty to do so. And as a high moral tone can hardly be said to conduce very much to either one's health or one's happiness, in order to get up to town I have always pretended to have a younger brother of the name of Ernest, who lives in the Albany, and gets into the most dreadful scrapes. That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth pure and simple. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
         <p> The truth is rarely pure and never simple. Modern life would be very tedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete impossibility! </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
         <p> That wouldn't be at all a bad thing. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
         <p> Literary criticism is not your forte, my dear fellow. Don't try it. You should leave that to people who haven't been at a University. They do it so well in the daily papers. What you really are is a Bunburyist. I was quite right in saying you were a Bunburyist. You are one of the most advanced Bunburyists I know. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
         <p> What on earth do you mean? </p></sp>

       <sp who="#alg" type="monologue"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
         <p> You have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest, in order that you may be able to come up to town as often as you like. I have invented an invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury, in order that I may be able to go down into the country whenever I choose. Bunbury is perfectly invaluable. If it wasn't for Bunbury's extraordinary bad health, for instance, I wouldn't be able to dine with you at Willis's to-night, for I have been really engaged to Aunt Augusta for more than a week. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
         <p> I haven't asked you to dine with me anywhere to-night. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
         <p> I know. You are absurdly careless about sending out invitations. It is very foolish of you. Nothing annoys people so much as not receiving invitations. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
         <p> You had much better dine with your Aunt Augusta. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#alg" type="monologue"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
         <p> I haven't the smallest intention of doing anything of the kind. To begin with, I dined there on Monday, and once a week is quite enough to dine with one's own relations. In the second place, whenever I do dine there I am always treated as a member of the family, and sent down with either no woman at all, or two. In the third place, I know perfectly well whom she will place me next to, to-night. She will place me next Mary Farquhar, who always flirts with her own husband across the dinner-table. That is not very pleasant. Indeed, it is not even decent . . . and that sort of thing is enormously on the increase. The amount of women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly scandalous. It looks so bad. It is simply washing one's clean linen in public. Besides, now that I know you to be a confirmed Bunburyist I naturally want to talk to you about Bunburying. I want to tell you the rules. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
         <p> I'm not a Bunburyist at all. If Gwendolen accepts me, I am going to kill my brother, indeed I think I'll kill him in any case. Cecily is a little too much interested in him. It is rather a bore. So I am going to get rid of Ernest. And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr. . . . with your invalid friend who has the absurd name. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
         <p> Nothing will induce me to part with Bunbury, and if you ever get married, which seems to me extremely problematic, you will be very glad to know Bunbury. A man who marries without knowing Bunbury has a very tedious time of it. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
         <p> That is nonsense. If I marry a charming girl like Gwendolen, and she is the only girl I ever saw in my life that I would marry, I certainly won't want to know Bunbury. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
         <p> Then your wife will. You don't seem to realise, that in married life three is company and two is none. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
         <p> <stage type="delivery">[Sententiously.]</stage> That, my dear young friend, is the theory that the corrupt French Drama has been propounding for the last fifty years. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>

Only relatives, or creditors, ever ring in that Wagnerian manner.

       <sp who="#jack"><speaker>JACK.</speaker>
         <p> I suppose so, if you want to. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#alg"><speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>

       <p><stage type="delivery">[Frowning.]</stage> I hope not, Algernon. It would put my table completely out. Your uncle would have to dine upstairs. Fortunately he is accustomed to that. </p></sp>

       <p> It is a great bore, and, I need hardly say, a terrible disappointment to me, but the fact is I have just had a telegram to say that my poor friend Bunbury is very ill again. <stage type="business">[Exchanges glances with Jack.]</stage> They seem to think I should be with him. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker>
       <p>It is very strange. This Mr. Bunbury seems to suffer from curiously bad health. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
       <p> Yes; poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#brack" type="monologue"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker>
       <p>Well, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time that Mr. Bunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die. This shilly-shallying with the question is absurd. Nor do I in any way approve of the modern sympathy with invalids. I consider it morbid. Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others. Health is the primary duty of life. I am always telling that to your poor uncle, but he never seems to take much notice . . . as far as any improvement in his ailment goes. I should be much obliged if you would ask Mr. Bunbury, from me, to be kind enough not to have a relapse on Saturday, for I rely on you to arrange my music for me. It is my last reception, and one wants something that will encourage conversation, particularly at the end of the season when every one has practically said whatever they had to say, which, in most cases, was probably not much. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker>
       <p> I'll speak to Bunbury, Aunt Augusta, if he is still conscious, and I think I can promise you he'll be all right by Saturday. Of course the music is a great difficulty. You see, if one plays good music, people don't listen, and if one plays bad music people don't talk. But I'll run over the programme I've drawn out, if you will kindly come into the next room for a moment. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#brack" type="monologue"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker>
       <p>Thank you, Algernon. It is very thoughtful of you. <stage type="blocking">[Rising, and following Algernon.]</stage> I'm sure the programme will be delightful, after a few expurgations.

       <p>Yes, I am quite well aware of the fact. And I often wish that in public, at any rate, you had been more demonstrative. For me you have always had an irresistible fascination. Even before I met you I was far from indifferent to you. <stage who="#jack" type="business">[<b>Jack</b> looks at her in amazement.]</stage> We live, as I hope you know, Mr. Worthing, in an age of ideals. The fact is constantly mentioned in the more expensive monthly magazines, and has reached the provincial pulpits, I am told; and my ideal has always been to love some one of the name of Ernest.

The whole theory of modern education is radically unsound. Fortunately in England, at any rate, education produces no effect whatsoever. If it did, it would prove a serious danger to the upper classes, and probably lead to acts of violence in Grosvenor Square. What is your income? </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker>
       <p> Between seven and eight thousand a year. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker>
       <p> <stage type="business">[Makes a note in her book.]</stage> In land, or in investments? </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker>
       <p> In investments, chiefly. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker>
       <p>  That is satisfactory. What between the duties expected of one during one's lifetime, and the duties exacted from one after one's death, land has ceased to be either a profit or a pleasure. It gives one position, and prevents one from keeping it up. That's all that can be said about land. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker>
       <p> I have a country house with some land, of course, attached to it, about fifteen hundred acres, I believe; but I don't depend on that for my real income. In fact, as far as I can make out, the poachers are the only people who make anything out of it. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker>
       <p>  A country house! How many bedrooms? Well, that point can be cleared up afterwards. You have a town house, I hope? A girl with a simple, unspoiled nature, like Gwendolen, could hardly be expected to reside in the country. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker>
       <p> Well, I own a house in Belgrave Square, but it is let by the year to Lady Bloxham. Of course, I can get it back whenever I like, at six months' notice. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker>
       <p>  Lady Bloxham? I don't know her. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker>

       <sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker>

       <sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker>

       <sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker>
       <p> Well, I am afraid I really have none. I am a Liberal Unionist. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker>
       <p>  Oh, they count as Tories. They dine with us. Or come in the evening, at any rate. Now to minor matters. Are your parents living? </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker>
       <p> I have lost both my parents. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker>
       <p>  To lose one parent, Mr. Worthing, may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness. Who was your father? He was evidently a man of some wealth. Was he born in what the Radical papers call the purple of commerce, or did he rise from the ranks of the aristocracy? </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker>
       <p> I am afraid I really don't know. The fact is, Lady Bracknell, I said I had lost my parents. It would be nearer the truth to say that my parents seem to have lost me . . . I don't actually know who I am by birth. I was . . . well, I was found. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker>
       <p>  Found! </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker>
       <p> The late Mr. Thomas Cardew, an old gentleman of a very charitable and kindly disposition, found me, and gave me the name of Worthing, because he happened to have a first-class ticket for Worthing in his pocket at the time. Worthing is a place in Sussex. It is a seaside resort. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker>
       <p>  Where did the charitable gentleman who had a first-class ticket for this seaside resort find you? </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker>
       <p> <stage type="delivery">[Gravely.]</stage> In a hand-bag. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker>
       <p>  A hand-bag? </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker>
       <p> <stage type="delivery">[Very seriously.]</stage> Yes, Lady Bracknell. I was in a hand-bag—a somewhat large, black leather hand-bag, with handles to it—an ordinary hand-bag in fact. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker>
       <p>  In what locality did this Mr. James, or Thomas, Cardew come across this ordinary hand-bag? </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker>
       <p> In the cloak-room at Victoria Station. It was given to him in mistake for his own. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker>
       <p>  The cloak-room at Victoria Station? </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker>
       <p> Yes. The Brighton line. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#brack" type="monologue"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker>
       <p> The line is immaterial. Mr. Worthing, I confess I feel somewhat bewildered by what you have just told me. To be born, or at any rate bred, in a hand-bag, whether it had handles or not, seems to me to display a contempt for the ordinary decencies of family life that reminds one of the worst excesses of the French Revolution. And I presume you know what that unfortunate movement led to? As for the particular locality in which the hand-bag was found, a cloak-room at a railway station might serve to conceal a social indiscretion—has probably, indeed, been used for that purpose before now—but it could hardly be regarded as an assured basis for a recognised position in good society. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker>
       <p> May I ask you then what you would advise me to do? I need hardly say I would do anything in the world to ensure Gwendolen's happiness. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker>
       <p>  I would strongly advise you, Mr. Worthing, to try and acquire some relations as soon as possible, and to make a definite effort to produce at any rate one parent, of either sex, before the season is quite over. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker>
       <p> Well, I don't see how I could possibly manage to do that. I can produce the hand-bag at any moment. It is in my dressing-room at home. I really think that should satisfy you, Lady Bracknell. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  Me, sir! What has it to do with me? You can hardly imagine that I and Lord Bracknell would dream of allowing our only daughter—a girl brought up with the utmost care—to marry into a cloak-room, and form an alliance with a parcel? Good morning, Mr. Worthing! </p></sp>

      <p>Garden at the Manor House. A flight of grey stone steps leads up to the house. The garden, an old-fashioned one, full of roses. Time of year, July. Basket chairs, and a table covered with books, are set under a large yew-tree. </p>

    <sp who="#prism"><speaker>MISS PRISM.</speaker>
    <p> <stage type="delivery">[Calling.]</stage> Cecily, Cecily! Surely such a utilitarian occupation as the watering of flowers is rather Moulton's duty than yours? Especially at a moment when intellectual pleasures await you. Your German grammar is on the table. Pray open it at page fifteen. We will repeat yesterday's lesson. </p></sp>

    <sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker>
    <p> <stage type="blocking">[Coming over very slowly.]</stage> But I don't like German. It isn't at all a becoming language. I know perfectly well that I look quite plain after my German lesson. </p></sp>

    <sp who="#prism"><speaker>MISS PRISM.</speaker>
    <p> Child, you know how anxious your guardian is that you should improve yourself in every way. He laid particular stress on your German, as he was leaving for town yesterday. Indeed, he always lays stress on your German when he is leaving for town. </p></sp>

    <sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker>
    <p> Dear Uncle Jack is so very serious! Sometimes he is so serious that I think he cannot be quite well. </p></sp>

    <sp who="#prism"><speaker>MISS PRISM.</speaker>
    <p> <stage type="delivery">[Drawing herself up.]</stage> Your guardian enjoys the best of health, and his gravity of demeanour is especially to be commended in one so comparatively young as he is. I know no one who has a higher sense of duty and responsibility. </p></sp>

    <sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker>
    <p> I suppose that is why he often looks a little bored when we three are together. </p></sp>

    <sp who="#prism"><speaker>MISS PRISM.</speaker>
    <p> Cecily! I am surprised at you. Mr. Worthing has many troubles in his life. Idle merriment and triviality would be out of place in his conversation. You must remember his constant anxiety about that unfortunate young man his brother. </p></sp>

    <sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker>
    <p> I wish Uncle Jack would allow that unfortunate young man, his brother, to come down here sometimes. We might have a good influence over him, Miss Prism. I am sure you certainly would. You know German, and geology, and things of that kind influence a man very much. <stage type="prop">[Cecily begins to write in her diary.]</stage> </p></sp>

    <sp who="#prism" type="monologue"><speaker>MISS PRISM.</speaker>
    <p> <stage type="delivery">[Shaking her head.]</stage> I do not think that even I could produce any effect on a character that according to his own brother's admission is irretrievably weak and vacillating. Indeed I am not sure that I would desire to reclaim him. I am not in favour of this modern mania for turning bad people into good people at a moment's notice. As a man sows so let him reap. You must put away your diary, Cecily. I really don't see why you should keep a diary at all. </p></sp>

    <sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker>
    <p> I keep a diary in order to enter the wonderful secrets of my life. If I didn't write them down, I should probably forget all about them. </p></sp>

    <sp who="#prism"><speaker>MISS PRISM.</speaker>
    <p> Memory, my dear Cecily, is the diary that we all carry about with us. </p></sp>

    <sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker>
    <p> Yes, but it usually chronicles the things that have never happened, and couldn't possibly have happened. I believe that Memory is responsible for nearly all the three-volume novels that Mudie sends us. </p></sp>

    <sp who="#prism"><speaker>MISS PRISM.</speaker>
    <p> Do not speak slightingly of the three-volume novel, Cecily. I wrote one myself in earlier days. </p></sp>

    <sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker>
    <p> Did you really, Miss Prism? How wonderfully clever you are! I hope it did not end happily? I don't like novels that end happily. They depress me so much. </p></sp>

    <sp who="#prism"><speaker>MISS PRISM.</speaker>
    <p> The good ended happily, and the bad unhappily. That is what Fiction means. </p></sp>

    <sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker>
    <p> I suppose so. But it seems very unfair. And was your novel ever published? </p></sp>

    <sp who="#prism"><speaker>MISS PRISM.</speaker>
    <p> Alas! no. The manuscript unfortunately was abandoned. <stage who="#ceci" type="business">[Cecily starts.]</stage> I use the word in the sense of lost or mislaid. To your work, child, these speculations are profitless. </p></sp>

    <sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker>
    <p> <stage type="delivery">[Smiling.]</stage> But I see dear Dr. Chasuble coming up through the garden. </p></sp>

    <p> That is strange.

    <p> We do not expect him till Monday afternoon. </p></sp>

    <sp who="#chas"><speaker>CHASUBLE.</speaker>
    <p> Ah yes, he usually likes to spend his Sunday in London. He is not one of those whose sole aim is enjoyment, as, by all accounts, that unfortunate young man his brother seems to be. But I must not disturb Egeria and her pupil any longer. </p></sp>

<sp who="#chas"><speaker>CHASUBLE.</speaker> <p> But have you any grave doubts on the subject? </p></sp>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> I certainly intend to have. Of
course I don't know if the thing would bother you in any way, or if you think I
am a little too old now. </p></sp>

<sp who="#chas"><speaker>CHASUBLE.</speaker> <p> Not at all. The sprinkling, and, indeed, the immersion of
    adults is a perfectly canonical practice. </p></sp>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Immersion! </p></sp>

<sp who="#chas"><speaker>CHASUBLE.</speaker> <p> You need have no apprehensions. Sprinkling is all that is
    necessary, or indeed I think advisable. Our weather is so changeable. At
    what hour would you wish the ceremony performed? </p></sp>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Oh, I might trot round about five
if that would suit you. </p></sp>

<sp who="#chas"><speaker>CHASUBLE.</speaker> <p> Perfectly, perfectly! In fact I have two similar
    ceremonies to perform at that time. A case of twins that occurred recently
    in one of the outlying cottages on your own estate. Poor Jenkins the carter,
    a most hard-working man. </p></sp>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Oh! I don't see much fun in being
christened along with other babies. It would be childish. Would half-past five
do? </p></sp>

<sp who="#chas"><speaker>CHASUBLE.</speaker> <p> Admirably! Admirably! [Takes out watch.] And now, dear
    Mr. Worthing, I will not intrude any longer into a house of sorrow. I would
    merely beg you not to be too much bowed down by grief. What seem to us
    bitter trials are often blessings in disguise. </p></sp>

<sp who="#prism"><speaker>MISS PRISM.</speaker> <p> This seems to me a blessing of an extremely obvious
    kind. </p></sp>
</div2>
<div>
<p>[Enter <b>Cecily</b> from the house.] </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Uncle Jack! Oh, I am pleased to see you back. But what
    horrid clothes you have got on! Do go and change them. </p></sp>

<sp who="#prism"><speaker>MISS PRISM.</speaker> <p> Cecily! </p></sp>

<sp who="#chas"><speaker>CHASUBLE.</speaker> <p> My child! my child! [<b>Cecily</b> goes towards
    <b>Jack</b>; he kisses her brow in a melancholy manner.] </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> What is the matter, Uncle Jack? Do look happy! You look as
    if you had toothache, and I have got such a surprise for you. Who do you
    think is in the dining-room? Your brother! </p></sp>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Who? </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Your brother Ernest. He arrived about half an hour ago.
    </p></sp>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> What nonsense! I haven't got a
brother. </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Oh, don't say that. However badly he may have behaved to
    you in the past he is still your brother. You couldn't be so heartless as to
    disown him. I'll tell him to come out. And you will shake hands with him,
    won't you, Uncle Jack? [Runs back into the house.] </p></sp>
</div2>
<div2>
<sp who="#chas"><speaker>CHASUBLE.</speaker> <p> These are very joyful tidings. </p></sp>

<sp who="#prism"><speaker>MISS PRISM.</speaker> <p> After we had all been resigned to his loss, his sudden
    return seems to me peculiarly distressing. </p></sp>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> My brother is in the dining-room?
I don't know what it all means. I think it is perfectly absurd. </p></sp>
</div2>
<div2>
<p>[Enter <b>Algernon</b> and <b>Cecily</b> hand in hand. They come slowly
    up to <b>Jack</b>.] </p></sp>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Good heavens! [Motions
<b>Algernon</b> away.] </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Brother John, I have come
    down from town to tell you that I am very sorry for all the trouble I have
    given you, and that I intend to lead a better life in the future.
    [<b>Jack</b> glares at him and does not take his hand.] </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Uncle Jack, you are not going to refuse your own brother's
    hand? </p></sp>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Nothing will induce me to take his
hand. I think his coming down here disgraceful. He knows perfectly well why.
</p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Uncle Jack, do be nice. There is some good in every one.
    Ernest has just been telling me about his poor invalid friend Mr. Bunbury
    whom he goes to visit so often. And surely there must be much good in one
    who is kind to an invalid, and leaves the pleasures of London to sit by a
    bed of pain. </p></sp>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Oh! he has been talking about
Bunbury, has he? </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Yes, he has told me all about poor Mr. Bunbury, and his
    terrible state of health. </p></sp>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Bunbury! Well, I won't have him
talk to you about Bunbury or about anything else. It is enough to drive one
perfectly frantic. </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Of course I admit that the
    faults were all on my side. But I must say that I think that Brother John's
    coldness to me is peculiarly painful. I expected a more enthusiastic
    welcome, especially considering it is the first time I have come here. </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Uncle Jack, if you don't shake hands with Ernest I will
    never forgive you. </p></sp>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Never forgive me? </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Never, never, never! </p></sp>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Well, this is the last time I
shall ever do it. [Shakes with <b>Algernon</b> and glares.] </p></sp>

<sp who="#chas"><speaker>CHASUBLE.</speaker> <p> It's pleasant, is it not, to see so perfect a
    reconciliation? I think we might leave the two brothers together. </p></sp>

<sp who="#prism"><speaker>MISS PRISM.</speaker> <p> Cecily, you will come with us. </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Certainly, Miss Prism. My little task of reconciliation is
    over. </p></sp>

<sp who="#chas"><speaker>CHASUBLE.</speaker> <p> You have done a beautiful action to-day, dear child. </p></sp>

<sp who="#prism"><speaker>MISS PRISM.</speaker> <p> We must not be premature in our judgments. </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> I feel very happy. [They all go off except <b>Jack</b> and
    <b>Algernon</b>.] </p></sp>
</div2>
<div2>
<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> You young scoundrel, Algy, you
must get out of this place as soon as possible. I don't allow any Bunburying
here. </p></sp>
</div2>
<div2>
<p>[Enter <b>Merriman</b>.] </p></sp>

<sp who="#merri"><speaker>MERRIMAN.</speaker> <p> I have put Mr. Ernest's things in the room next to yours,
    sir. I suppose that is all right? </p></sp>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> What? </p></sp>

<sp who="#merri"><speaker>MERRIMAN.</speaker> <p> Mr. Ernest's luggage, sir. I have unpacked it and put it
    in the room next to your own. </p></sp>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> His luggage? </p></sp>

<sp who="#merri"><speaker>MERRIMAN.</speaker> <p> Yes, sir. Three portmanteaus, a dressing-case, two
    hat-boxes, and a large luncheon-basket. </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> I am afraid I can't stay
    more than a week this time. </p></sp>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Merriman, order the dog-cart at
once. Mr. Ernest has been suddenly called back to town. </p></sp>

<sp who="#merri"><speaker>MERRIMAN.</speaker> <p> Yes, sir. [Goes back into the house.] </p></sp>
</div2>
<div2>
<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> What a fearful liar you
    are, Jack. I have not been called back to town at all. </p></sp>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Yes, you have. </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> I haven't heard any one
    call me. </p></sp>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Your duty as a gentleman calls you
back. </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> My duty as a gentleman has
    never interfered with my pleasures in the smallest degree. </p></sp>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> I can quite understand that. </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Well, Cecily is a darling.
    </p></sp>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> You are not to talk of Miss Cardew
like that. I don't like it. </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Well, I don't like your
    clothes. You look perfectly ridiculous in them. Why on earth don't you go up
    and change? It is perfectly childish to be in deep mourning for a man who is
    actually staying for a whole week with you in your house as a guest. I call
    it grotesque. </p></sp>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> You are certainly not staying with
me for a whole week as a guest or anything else. You have got to leave . . . by
the four-five train. </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> I certainly won't leave you
    so long as you are in mourning. It would be most unfriendly. If I were in
    mourning you would stay with me, I suppose. I should think it very unkind if
    you didn't. </p></sp>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Well, will you go if I change my
clothes? </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Yes, if you are not too
    long. I never saw anybody take so long to dress, and with such little
    result. </p></sp>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Well, at any rate, that is better
than being always over-dressed as you are. </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> If I am occasionally a
    little over-dressed, I make up for it by being always immensely
    over-educated. </p></sp>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Your vanity is ridiculous, your
conduct an outrage, and your presence in my garden utterly absurd. However, you
have got to catch the four-five, and I hope you will have a pleasant journey
back to town. This Bunburying, as you call it, has not been a great success for
you. </p></sp>

<p>[Goes into the house.] </p></sp>
</div2>
<div2>
<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> I think it has been a great
    success. I'm in love with Cecily, and that is everything. </p></sp>
</div2>
<div2>
<p>[Enter <b>Cecily</b> at the back of the garden. She picks up the can and
    begins to water the flowers.] But I must see her before I go, and make
    arrangements for another Bunbury. Ah, there she is. </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Oh, I merely came back to water the roses. I thought you
    were with Uncle Jack. </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> He's gone to order the
    dog-cart for me. </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Oh, is he going to take you for a nice drive? </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> He's going to send me away.
    </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Then have we got to part? </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> I am afraid so. It's a very
    painful parting. </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> It is always painful to part from people whom one has known
    for a very brief space of time. The absence of old friends one can endure
    with equanimity. But even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one has
    just been introduced is almost unbearable. </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Thank you. </p></sp>
</div2>
<div2>
<p>[Enter <b>Merriman</b>.] </p></sp>

<sp who="#merri"><speaker>MERRIMAN.</speaker> <p> The dog-cart is at the door, sir. [<b>Algernon</b> looks
    appealingly at <b>Cecily</b>.] </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> It can wait, Merriman for . . . five minutes. </p></sp>

<sp who="#merri"><speaker>MERRIMAN.</speaker> <p> Yes, Miss. [Exit <b>Merriman</b>.] </p></sp>
</div2>
<div2>
<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> I hope, Cecily, I shall not
    offend you if I state quite frankly and openly that you seem to me to be in
    every way the visible personification of absolute perfection. </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> I think your frankness does you great credit, Ernest. If
    you will allow me, I will copy your remarks into my diary. [Goes over to
    table and begins writing in diary.] </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Do you really keep a diary?
    I'd give anything to look at it. May I? </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Oh no. [Puts her hand over it.] You see, it is simply a
    very young girl's record of her own thoughts and impressions, and
    consequently meant for publication. When it appears in volume form I hope
    you will order a copy. But pray, Ernest, don't stop. I delight in taking
    down from dictation. I have reached 'absolute perfection'. You can go on. I
    am quite ready for more. </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> [Somewhat taken aback.]
    Ahem! Ahem! </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Oh, don't cough, Ernest. When one is dictating one should
    speak fluently and not cough. Besides, I don't know how to spell a cough.
    [Writes as <b>Algernon</b> speaks.] </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> [Speaking very rapidly.]
    Cecily, ever since I first looked upon your wonderful and incomparable
    beauty, I have dared to love you wildly, passionately, devotedly,
    hopelessly. </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> I don't think that you should tell me that you love me
    wildly, passionately, devotedly, hopelessly. Hopelessly doesn't seem to make
    much sense, does it? </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Cecily! </p></sp>
</div2>
<div2>
<p>[Enter <b>Merriman</b>.] </p></sp>

<sp who="#merri"><speaker>MERRIMAN.</speaker> <p> The dog-cart is waiting, sir. </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Tell it to come round next
    week, at the same hour. </p></sp>

<sp who="#merri"><speaker>MERRIMAN.</speaker> <p> [Looks at <b>Cecily</b>, who makes no sign.] Yes, sir.
    </p></sp>

<p>[<b>Merriman</b> retires.] </p></sp>
</div2>
<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Uncle Jack would be very much annoyed if he knew you were
    staying on till next week, at the same hour. </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Oh, I don't care about
    Jack. I don't care for anybody in the whole world but you. I love you,
    Cecily. You will marry me, won't you? </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> You silly boy! Of course. Why, we have been engaged for the
    last three months. </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> For the last three months?
    </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Yes, it will be exactly three months on Thursday. </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> But how did we become
    engaged? </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Well, ever since dear Uncle Jack first confessed to us that
    he had a younger brother who was very wicked and bad, you of course have
    formed the chief topic of conversation between myself and Miss Prism. And of
    course a man who is much talked about is always very attractive. One feels
    there must be something in him, after all. I daresay it was foolish of me,
    but I fell in love with you, Ernest. </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Darling! And when was the
    engagement actually settled? </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> On the 14th of February last. Worn out by your entire
    ignorance of my existence, I determined to end the matter one way or the
    other, and after a long struggle with myself I accepted you under this dear
    old tree here. The next day I bought this little ring in your name, and this
    is the little bangle with the true lover's knot I promised you always to
    wear. </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Did I give you this? It's
    very pretty, isn't it? </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Yes, you've wonderfully good taste, Ernest. It's the excuse
    I've always given for your leading such a bad life. And this is the box in
    which I keep all your dear letters. [Kneels at table, opens box, and
    produces letters tied up with blue ribbon.] </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> My letters! But, my own
    sweet Cecily, I have never written you any letters. </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> You need hardly remind me of that, Ernest. I remember only
    too well that I was forced to write your letters for you. I wrote always
    three times a week, and sometimes oftener. </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Oh, do let me read them,
    Cecily? </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Oh, I couldn't possibly. They would make you far too
    conceited. [Replaces box.] The three you wrote me after I had broken off the
    engagement are so beautiful, and so badly spelled, that even now I can
    hardly read them without crying a little. </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> But was our engagement ever
    broken off? </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Of course it was. On the 22nd of last March. You can see
    the entry if you like. [Shows diary.] 'To-day I broke off my engagement with
    Ernest. I feel it is better to do so. The weather still continues charming.'
    </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> But why on earth did you
    break it off? What had I done? I had done nothing at all. Cecily, I am very
    much hurt indeed to hear you broke it off. Particularly when the weather was
    so charming. </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> It would hardly have been a really serious engagement if it
    hadn't been broken off at least once. But I forgave you before the week was
    out. </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> [Crossing to her, and
    kneeling.] What a perfect angel you are, Cecily. </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> You dear romantic boy. [He kisses her, she puts her fingers
    through his hair.] I hope your hair curls naturally, does it? </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Yes, darling, with a little
    help from others. </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> I am so glad. </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> You'll never break off our
    engagement again, Cecily? </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> I don't think I could break it off now that I have actually
    met you. Besides, of course, there is the question of your name. </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Yes, of course.
    [Nervously.] </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> You must not laugh at me, darling, but it had always been a
    girlish dream of mine to love some one whose name was Ernest.
    [<b>Algernon</b> rises, <b>Cecily</b> also.] There is something in that name
    that seems to inspire absolute confidence. I pity any poor married woman
    whose husband is not called Ernest. </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> But, my dear child, do you
    mean to say you could not love me if I had some other name? </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> But what name? </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Oh, any name you
    like—Algernon—for instance . . . </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> But I don't like the name of Algernon. </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Well, my own dear, sweet,
    loving little darling, I really can't see why you should object to the name
    of Algernon. It is not at all a bad name. In fact, it is rather an
    aristocratic name. Half of the chaps who get into the Bankruptcy Court are
    called Algernon. But seriously, Cecily . . . [Moving to her] . . . if my
    name was Algy, couldn't you love me? </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> [Rising.] I might respect you, Ernest, I might admire your
    character, but I fear that I should not be able to give you my undivided
    attention. </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Ahem! Cecily! [Picking up
    hat.] Your Rector here is, I suppose, thoroughly experienced in the practice
    of all the rites and ceremonials of the Church? </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Oh, yes. Dr. Chasuble is a most learned man. He has never
    written a single book, so you can imagine how much he knows. </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> I must see him at once on a
    most important christening—I mean on most important business. </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Oh! </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> I shan't be away more than
    half an hour. </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Considering that we have been engaged since February the
    14th, and that I only met you to-day for the first time, I think it is
    rather hard that you should leave me for so long a period as half an hour.
    Couldn't you make it twenty minutes? </p></sp>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> I'll be back in no time.
    </p></sp>

<p>[Kisses her and rushes down the garden.] </p></sp>
</div2>
<div2>
<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> What an impetuous boy he is! I like his hair so much. I
    must enter his proposal in my diary. </p></sp>
</div2>
<div2>
<p>[Enter <b>Merriman</b>.] </p></sp>

<sp who="#merri"><speaker>MERRIMAN.</speaker> <p> A Miss Fairfax has just called to see Mr. Worthing. On
    very important business, Miss Fairfax states. </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Isn't Mr. Worthing in his library? </p></sp>

<sp who="#merri"><speaker>MERRIMAN.</speaker> <p> Mr. Worthing went over in the direction of the Rectory
    some time ago. </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Pray ask the lady to come out here; Mr. Worthing is sure to
    be back soon. And you can bring tea. </p></sp>

<sp who="#merri"><speaker>MERRIMAN.</speaker> <p> Yes, Miss. [Goes out.] </p></sp>
</div2>
<div2>
<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Miss Fairfax! I suppose one of the many good elderly women
    who are associated with Uncle Jack in some of his philanthropic work in
    London. I don't quite like women who are interested in philanthropic work. I
    think it is so forward of them. </p></sp>
</div2>
<div2>
<p>[Enter <b>Merriman</b>.] </p></sp>

<sp who="#merri"><speaker>MERRIMAN.</speaker> <p> Miss Fairfax. </p></sp>
</div2>
<div2>
<p>[Enter <b>Gwendolen</b>.] </p></sp>

<p>[Exit <b>Merriman</b>.] </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> [Advancing to meet her.] Pray let me introduce myself to
    you. My name is Cecily Cardew. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  Cecily Cardew? [Moving to her and shaking hands.] What a
    very sweet name! Something tells me that we are going to be great friends. I
    like you already more than I can say. My first impressions of people are
    never wrong. </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> How nice of you to like me so much after we have known each
    other such a comparatively short time. Pray sit down. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  [Still standing up.] I may call you Cecily, may I not?
    </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> With pleasure! </p></sp>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  And you will always call me Gwendolen, won't you? </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> If you wish. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  Then that is all quite settled, is it not? </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> I hope so. [A pause. They both sit down together.] </p></sp>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  Perhaps this might be a favourable opportunity for my
    mentioning who I am. My father is Lord Bracknell. You have never heard of
    papa, I suppose? </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> I don't think so. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  Outside the family circle, papa, I am glad to say, is
    entirely unknown. I think that is quite as it should be. The home seems to
    me to be the proper sphere for the man. And certainly once a man begins to
    neglect his domestic duties he becomes painfully effeminate, does he not?
    And I don't like that. It makes men so very attractive. Cecily, mamma, whose
    views on education are remarkably strict, has brought me up to be extremely
    short-sighted; it is part of her system; so do you mind my looking at you
    through my glasses? </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Oh! not at all, Gwendolen. I am very fond of being looked
    at. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  [After examining <b>Cecily</b> carefully through a
    lorgnette.] You are here on a short visit, I suppose. </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Oh no! I live here. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  [Severely.] Really? Your mother, no doubt, or some
    female relative of advanced years, resides here also? </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Oh no! I have no mother, nor, in fact, any relations. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  Indeed? </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> My dear guardian, with the assistance of Miss Prism, has
    the arduous task of looking after me. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  Your guardian? </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Yes, I am Mr. Worthing's ward. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  Oh! It is strange he never mentioned to me that he had a
    ward. How secretive of him! He grows more interesting hourly. I am not sure,
    however, that the news inspires me with feelings of unmixed delight. [Rising
    and going to her.] I am very fond of you, Cecily; I have liked you ever
    since I met you! But I am bound to state that now that I know that you are
    Mr. Worthing's ward, I cannot help expressing a wish you were—well, just a
    little older than you seem to be—and not quite so very alluring in
    appearance. In fact, if I may speak candidly— </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Pray do! I think that whenever one has anything unpleasant
    to say, one should always be quite candid. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  Well, to speak with perfect candour, Cecily, I wish that
    you were fully forty-two, and more than usually plain for your age. Ernest
    has a strong upright nature. He is the very soul of truth and honour.
    Disloyalty would be as impossible to him as deception. But even men of the
    noblest possible moral character are extremely susceptible to the influence
    of the physical charms of others. Modern, no less than Ancient History,
    supplies us with many most painful examples of what I refer to. If it were
    not so, indeed, History would be quite unreadable. </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> I beg your pardon, Gwendolen, did you say Ernest? </p></sp>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  Yes. </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Oh, but it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is my guardian.
    It is his brother—his elder brother. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  [Sitting down again.] Ernest never mentioned to me that
    he had a brother. </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> I am sorry to say they have not been on good terms for a
    long time. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  Ah! that accounts for it. And now that I think of it I
    have never heard any man mention his brother. The subject seems distasteful
    to most men. Cecily, you have lifted a load from my mind. I was growing
    almost anxious. It would have been terrible if any cloud had come across a
    friendship like ours, would it not? Of course you are quite, quite sure that
    it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is your guardian? </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Quite sure. [A pause.] In fact, I am going to be his. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  [Inquiringly.] I beg your pardon? </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> [Rather shy and confidingly.] Dearest Gwendolen, there is
    no reason why I should make a secret of it to you. Our little county
    newspaper is sure to chronicle the fact next week. Mr. Ernest Worthing and I
    are engaged to be married. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  [Quite politely, rising.] My darling Cecily, I think
    there must be some slight error. Mr. Ernest Worthing is engaged to me. The
    announcement will appear in the <i>Morning Post</i> on Saturday at the
    latest. </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> [Very politely, rising.] I am afraid you must be under some
    misconception. Ernest proposed to me exactly ten minutes ago. [Shows diary.]
    </p></sp>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  [Examines diary through her lorgnettte carefully.] It is
    certainly very curious, for he asked me to be his wife yesterday afternoon
    at 5.30. If you would care to verify the incident, pray do so. [Produces
    diary of her own.] I never travel without my diary. One should always have
    something sensational to read in the train. I am so sorry, dear Cecily, if
    it is any disappointment to you, but I am afraid I have the prior claim.
    </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> It would distress me more than I can tell you, dear
    Gwendolen, if it caused you any mental or physical anguish, but I feel bound
    to point out that since Ernest proposed to you he clearly has changed his
    mind. </p></sp>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  [Meditatively.] If the poor fellow has been entrapped
    into any foolish promise I shall consider it my duty to rescue him at once,
    and with a firm hand. </p></sp>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> [Thoughtfully and sadly.] Whatever unfortunate entanglement
    my dear boy may have got into, I will never reproach him with it after we
    are married. </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  Do you allude to me, Miss Cardew, as an entanglement?
    You are presumptuous. On an occasion of this kind it becomes more than a
    moral duty to speak one's mind. It becomes a pleasure. </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Do you suggest, Miss Fairfax, that I entrapped Ernest into
    an engagement? How dare you? This is no time for wearing the shallow mask of
    manners. When I see a spade I call it a spade. </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  [Satirically.] I am glad to say that I have never seen a
    spade. It is obvious that our social spheres have been widely different.
    </p>

<p>[Enter <b>Merriman</b>, followed by the footman. He carries a salver,
    table cloth, and plate stand. <b>Cecily</b> is about to retort. The presence
    of the servants exercises a restraining influence, under which both girls
    chafe.] </p>

<sp who="#merri"><speaker>MERRIMAN.</speaker> <p> Shall I lay tea here as usual, Miss? </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> [Sternly, in a calm voice.] Yes, as usual. [<b>Merriman</b>
    begins to clear table and lay cloth. A long pause. <b>Cecily</b> and
    <b>Gwendolen</b> glare at each other.] </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  Are there many interesting walks in the vicinity, Miss
    Cardew? </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Oh! yes! a great many. From the top of one of the hills
    quite close one can see five counties. </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  Five counties! I don't think I should like that; I hate
    crowds. </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> [Sweetly.] I suppose that is why you live in town?
    [<b>Gwendolen</b> bites her lip, and beats her foot nervously with her
    parasol.] </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  [Looking round.] Quite a well-kept garden this is, Miss
    Cardew. </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> So glad you like it, Miss Fairfax. </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  I had no idea there were any flowers in the country.
    </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Oh, flowers are as common here, Miss Fairfax, as people are
    in London. </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  Personally I cannot understand how anybody manages to
    exist in the country, if anybody who is anybody does. The country always
    bores me to death. </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Ah! This is what the newspapers call agricultural
    depression, is it not? I believe the aristocracy are suffering very much
    from it just at present. It is almost an epidemic amongst them, I have been
    told. May I offer you some tea, Miss Fairfax? </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  [With elaborate politeness.] Thank you. [Aside.]
    Detestable girl! But I require tea! </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> [Sweetly.] Sugar? </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  [Superciliously.] No, thank you. Sugar is not
    fashionable any more. [<b>Cecily</b> looks angrily at her, takes up the
    tongs and puts four lumps of sugar into the cup.] </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> [Severely.] Cake or bread and butter? </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  [In a bored manner.] Bread and butter, please. Cake is
    rarely seen at the best houses nowadays. </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> [Cuts a very large slice of cake, and puts it on the tray.]
    Hand that to Miss Fairfax. </p>

<p>[<b>Merriman</b> does so, and goes out with footman. <b>Gwendolen</b>
    drinks the tea and makes a grimace. Puts down cup at once, reaches out her
    hand to the bread and butter, looks at it, and finds it is cake. Rises in
    indignation.] </p>
</div2>
<div2>
       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  You have filled my tea with lumps of sugar, and though I
    asked most distinctly for bread and butter, you have given me cake. I am
    known for the gentleness of my disposition, and the extraordinary sweetness
    of my nature, but I warn you, Miss Cardew, you may go too far. </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> [Rising.] To save my poor, innocent, trusting boy from the
    machinations of any other girl there are no lengths to which I would not go.
    </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  From the moment I saw you I distrusted you. I felt that
    you were false and deceitful. I am never deceived in such matters. My first
    impressions of people are invariably right. </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> It seems to me, Miss Fairfax, that I am trespassing on your
    valuable time. No doubt you have many other calls of a similar character to
    make in the neighbourhood. </p>
</div2>
<div2>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  [Catching sight of him.] Ernest! My own Ernest! </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Gwendolen! Darling! [Offers to
kiss her.] </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  [Draws back.] A moment! May I ask if you are engaged to
    be married to this young lady? [Points to <b>Cecily</b>.] </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> [Laughing.] To dear little Cecily!
Of course not! What could have put such an idea into your pretty little head?
</p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  Thank you. You may! [Offers her cheek.] </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> [Very sweetly.] I knew there must be some misunderstanding,
    Miss Fairfax. The gentleman whose arm is at present round your waist is my
    guardian, Mr. John Worthing. </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  I beg your pardon? </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Here is Ernest. </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> [Goes straight over to
    <b>Cecily</b> without noticing any one else.] My own love! [Offers to kiss
    her.] </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> [Drawing back.] A moment, Ernest! May I ask you—are you
    engaged to be married to this young lady? </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> [Looking round.] To what
    young lady? Good heavens! Gwendolen! </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Yes! to good heavens, Gwendolen, I mean to Gwendolen. </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> [Laughing.] Of course not!
    What could have put such an idea into your pretty little head? </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Thank you. [Presenting her cheek to be kissed.] You may.
    [<b>Algernon</b> kisses her.] </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  I felt there was some slight error, Miss Cardew. The
    gentleman who is now embracing you is my cousin, Mr. Algernon Moncrieff.
    </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> [Breaking away from <b>Algernon</b>.] Algernon Moncrieff!
    Oh! [The two girls move towards each other and put their arms round each
    other's waists as if for protection.] </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Are you called Algernon? </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> I cannot deny it. </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Oh! </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  Is your name really John? </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> [Standing rather proudly.] I could
deny it if I liked. I could deny anything if I liked. But my name certainly is
John. It has been John for years. </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> [To <b>Gwendolen</b>.] A gross deception has been practised
    on both of us. </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  My poor wounded Cecily! </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> My sweet wronged Gwendolen! </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  [Slowly and seriously.] You will call me sister, will
    you not? [They embrace. <b>Jack</b> and <b>Algernon</b> groan and walk up
    and down.] </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> [Rather brightly.] There is just one question I would like
    to be allowed to ask my guardian. </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  An admirable idea! Mr. Worthing, there is just one
    question I would like to be permitted to put to you. Where is your brother
    Ernest? We are both engaged to be married to your brother Ernest, so it is a
    matter of some importance to us to know where your brother Ernest is at
    present. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> [Slowly and hesitatingly.]
Gwendolen—Cecily—it is very painful for me to be forced to speak the truth. It
is the first time in my life that I have ever been reduced to such a painful
position, and I am really quite inexperienced in doing anything of the kind.
However, I will tell you quite frankly that I have no brother Ernest. I have no
brother at all. I never had a brother in my life, and I certainly have not the
smallest intention of ever having one in the future. </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> [Surprised.] No brother at all? </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> [Cheerily.] None! </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  [Severely.] Had you never a brother of any kind? </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> [Pleasantly.] Never. Not even of
any kind. </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  I am afraid it is quite clear, Cecily, that neither of
    us is engaged to be married to any one. </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> It is not a very pleasant position for a young girl
    suddenly to find herself in. Is it? </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  Let us go into the house. They will hardly venture to
    come after us there. </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> No, men are so cowardly, aren't they? </p>

<p>[They retire into the house with scornful looks.] </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> This ghastly state of things is
what you call Bunburying, I suppose? </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Yes, and a perfectly
    wonderful Bunbury it is. The most wonderful Bunbury I have ever had in my
    life. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Well, you've no right whatsoever
to Bunbury here. </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> That is absurd. One has a
    right to Bunbury anywhere one chooses. Every serious Bunburyist knows that.
    </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Serious Bunburyist! Good heavens!
</p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Well, one must be serious
    about something, if one wants to have any amusement in life. I happen to be
    serious about Bunburying. What on earth you are serious about I haven't got
    the remotest idea. About everything, I should fancy. You have such an
    absolutely trivial nature. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Well, the only small satisfaction
I have in the whole of this wretched business is that your friend Bunbury is
quite exploded. You won't be able to run down to the country quite so often as
you used to do, dear Algy. And a very good thing too. </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Your brother is a little
    off colour, isn't he, dear Jack? You won't be able to disappear to London
    quite so frequently as your wicked custom was. And not a bad thing either.
    </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> As for your conduct towards Miss
Cardew, I must say that your taking in a sweet, simple, innocent girl like that
is quite inexcusable. To say nothing of the fact that she is my ward. </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> I can see no possible
    defence at all for your deceiving a brilliant, clever, thoroughly
    experienced young lady like Miss Fairfax. To say nothing of the fact that
    she is my cousin. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> I wanted to be engaged to
Gwendolen, that is all. I love her. </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Well, I simply wanted to be
    engaged to Cecily. I adore her. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> There is certainly no chance of
your marrying Miss Cardew. </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> I don't think there is much
    likelihood, Jack, of you and Miss Fairfax being united. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Well, that is no business of
yours. </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> If it was my business, I
    wouldn't talk about it. [Begins to eat muffins.] It is very vulgar to talk
    about one's business. Only people like stock-brokers do that, and then
    merely at dinner parties. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> How can you sit there, calmly
eating muffins when we are in this horrible trouble, I can't make out. You seem
to me to be perfectly heartless. </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Well, I can't eat muffins
    in an agitated manner. The butter would probably get on my cuffs. One should
    always eat muffins quite calmly. It is the only way to eat them. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> I say it's perfectly heartless
your eating muffins at all, under the circumstances. </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> When I am in trouble,
    eating is the only thing that consoles me. Indeed, when I am in really great
    trouble, as any one who knows me intimately will tell you, I refuse
    everything except food and drink. At the present moment I am eating muffins
    because I am unhappy. Besides, I am particularly fond of muffins. [Rising.]
    </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> [Rising.] Well, that is no reason
why you should eat them all in that greedy way. [Takes muffins from
<b>Algernon</b>.] </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> [Offering tea-cake.] I wish
    you would have tea-cake instead. I don't like tea-cake. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Good heavens! I suppose a man may
eat his own muffins in his own garden. </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> But you have just said it
    was perfectly heartless to eat muffins. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> I said it was perfectly heartless
of you, under the circumstances. That is a very different thing. </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> That may be. But the
    muffins are the same. [He seizes the muffin-dish from <b>Jack</b>.] </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Algy, I wish to goodness you would
go. </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> You can't possibly ask me
    to go without having some dinner. It's absurd. I never go without my dinner.
    No one ever does, except vegetarians and people like that. Besides I have
    just made arrangements with Dr. Chasuble to be christened at a quarter to
    six under the name of Ernest. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> My dear fellow, the sooner you
give up that nonsense the better. I made arrangements this morning with Dr.
Chasuble to be christened myself at 5.30, and I naturally will take the name of
Ernest. Gwendolen would wish it. We can't both be christened Ernest. It's
absurd. Besides, I have a perfect right to be christened if I like. There is no
evidence at all that I have ever been christened by anybody. I should think it
extremely probable I never was, and so does Dr. Chasuble. It is entirely
different in your case. You have been christened already. </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Yes, but I have not been
    christened for years. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Yes, but you have been christened.
That is the important thing. </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Quite so. So I know my
    constitution can stand it. If you are not quite sure about your ever having
    been christened, I must say I think it rather dangerous your venturing on it
    now. It might make you very unwell. You can hardly have forgotten that some
    one very closely connected with you was very nearly carried off this week in
    Paris by a severe chill. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Yes, but you said yourself that a
severe chill was not hereditary. </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> It usen't to be, I know—but
    I daresay it is now. Science is always making wonderful improvements in
    things. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> [Picking up the muffin-dish.] Oh,
that is nonsense; you are always talking nonsense. </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Jack, you are at the
    muffins again! I wish you wouldn't. There are only two left. [Takes them.] I
    told you I was particularly fond of muffins. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> But I hate tea-cake. </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Why on earth then do you
    allow tea-cake to be served up for your guests? What ideas you have of
    hospitality! </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Algernon! I have already told you
to go. I don't want you here. Why don't you go! </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> I haven't quite finished my
    tea yet! and there is still one muffin left. [<b>Jack</b> groans, and sinks
    into a chair. <b>Algernon</b> still continues eating.] </p>

<p>Morning-room at the Manor House. </p>

<p>[<b>Gwendolen</b> and <b>Cecily</b> are at the window, looking out into
    the garden.] </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  The fact that they did not follow us at once into the
    house, as any one else would have done, seems to me to show that they have
    some sense of shame left. </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> They have been eating muffins. That looks like repentance.
    </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  [After a pause.] They don't seem to notice us at all.
    Couldn't you cough? </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> But I haven't got a cough. </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  They're looking at us. What effrontery! </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> They're approaching. That's very forward of them. </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  Let us preserve a dignified silence. </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Certainly. It's the only thing to do now. [Enter
    <b>Jack</b> followed by <b>Algernon</b>. They whistle some dreadful popular
    air from a British Opera.] </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  This dignified silence seems to produce an unpleasant
    effect. </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> A most distasteful one. </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  But we will not be the first to speak. </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Certainly not. </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  Mr. Worthing, I have something very particular to ask
    you. Much depends on your reply. </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Gwendolen, your common sense is invaluable. Mr. Moncrieff,
    kindly answer me the following question. Why did you pretend to be my
    guardian's brother? </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> In order that I might have
    an opportunity of meeting you. </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> [To <b>Gwendolen</b>.] That certainly seems a satisfactory
    explanation, does it not? </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  Yes, dear, if you can believe him. </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> I don't. But that does not affect the wonderful beauty of
    his answer. </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  True. In matters of grave importance, style, not
    sincerity is the vital thing. Mr. Worthing, what explanation can you offer
    to me for pretending to have a brother? Was it in order that you might have
    an opportunity of coming up to town to see me as often as possible? </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Can you doubt it, Miss Fairfax?
</p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  I have the gravest doubts upon the subject. But I intend
    to crush them. This is not the moment for German scepticism. [Moving to
    <b>Cecily</b>.] Their explanations appear to be quite satisfactory,
    especially Mr. Worthing's. That seems to me to have the stamp of truth upon
    it. </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> I am more than content with what Mr. Moncrieff said. His
    voice alone inspires one with absolute credulity. </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  Then you think we should forgive them? </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Yes. I mean no. </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  True! I had forgotten. There are principles at stake
    that one cannot surrender. Which of us should tell them? The task is not a
    pleasant one. </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Could we not both speak at the same time? </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  An excellent idea! I nearly always speak at the same
    time as other people. Will you take the time from me? </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Certainly. [<b>Gwendolen</b> beats time with uplifted
    finger.] </p>

<p>GWENDOLEN and CECILY [Speaking together.] Your Christian names are still
    an insuperable barrier. That is all! </p>

<p>JACK and ALGERNON [Speaking together.] Our Christian names! Is that all?
    But we are going to be christened this afternoon. </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  [To <b>Jack</b>.] For my sake you are prepared to do
    this terrible thing? </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> I am. </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> [To <b>Algernon</b>.] To please me you are ready to face
    this fearful ordeal? </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> I am! </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  How absurd to talk of the equality of the sexes! Where
    questions of self-sacrifice are concerned, men are infinitely beyond us.
    </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> We are. [Clasps hands with
<b>Algernon</b>.] </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> They have moments of physical courage of which we women
    know absolutely nothing. </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  [To <b>Jack</b>.] Darling! </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> [To <b>Cecily</b>.]
    Darling! [They fall into each other's arms.] </p>

<p>[Enter <b>Merriman</b>. When he enters he coughs loudly, seeing the
    situation.] </p>

<sp who="#merri"><speaker>MERRIMAN.</speaker> <p> Ahem! Ahem! Lady Bracknell! </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Good heavens! </p>

<p>[Enter <b>Lady Bracknell</b>. The couples separate in alarm. Exit
    <b>Merriman</b>.] </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  Gwendolen! What does this mean? </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  Merely that I am engaged to be married to Mr. Worthing,
    mamma. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  Come here. Sit down. Sit down immediately.
    Hesitation of any kind is a sign of mental decay in the young, of physical
    weakness in the old. [Turns to <b>Jack</b>.] Apprised, sir, of my daughter's
    sudden flight by her trusty maid, whose confidence I purchased by means of a
    small coin, I followed her at once by a luggage train. Her unhappy father
    is, I am glad to say, under the impression that she is attending a more than
    usually lengthy lecture by the University Extension Scheme on the Influence
    of a permanent income on Thought. I do not propose to undeceive him. Indeed
    I have never undeceived him on any question. I would consider it wrong. But
    of course, you will clearly understand that all communication between
    yourself and my daughter must cease immediately from this moment. On this
    point, as indeed on all points, I am firm. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> I am engaged to be married to
Gwendolen, Lady Bracknell! </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  You are nothing of the kind, sir. And now, as
    regards Algernon! . . . Algernon! </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Yes, Aunt Augusta. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  May I ask if it is in this house that your invalid
    friend Mr. Bunbury resides? </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> [Stammering.] Oh! No!
    Bunbury doesn't live here. Bunbury is somewhere else at present. In fact,
    Bunbury is dead. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  Dead! When did Mr. Bunbury die? His death must have
    been extremely sudden. </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> [Airily.] Oh! I killed
    Bunbury this afternoon. I mean poor Bunbury died this afternoon. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  What did he die of? </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Bunbury? Oh, he was quite
    exploded. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  Exploded! Was he the victim of a revolutionary
    outrage? I was not aware that Mr. Bunbury was interested in social
    legislation. If so, he is well punished for his morbidity. </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> My dear Aunt Augusta, I
    mean he was found out! The doctors found out that Bunbury could not live,
    that is what I mean—so Bunbury died. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  He seems to have had great confidence in the
    opinion of his physicians. I am glad, however, that he made up his mind at
    the last to some definite course of action, and acted under proper medical
    advice. And now that we have finally got rid of this Mr. Bunbury, may I ask,
    Mr. Worthing, who is that young person whose hand my nephew Algernon is now
    holding in what seems to me a peculiarly unnecessary manner? </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> That lady is Miss Cecily Cardew,
my ward. [<b>Lady Bracknell</b> bows coldly to <b>Cecily</b>.] </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> I am engaged to be married
    to Cecily, Aunt Augusta. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  I beg your pardon? </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Mr. Moncrieff and I are engaged to be married, Lady
    Bracknell. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  [With a shiver, crossing to the sofa and sitting
    down.] I do not know whether there is anything peculiarly exciting in the
    air of this particular part of Hertfordshire, but the number of engagements
    that go on seems to me considerably above the proper average that statistics
    have laid down for our guidance. I think some preliminary inquiry on my part
    would not be out of place. Mr. Worthing, is Miss Cardew at all connected
    with any of the larger railway stations in London? I merely desire
    information. Until yesterday I had no idea that there were any families or
    persons whose origin was a Terminus. [<b>Jack</b> looks perfectly furious,
    but restrains himself.] </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> [In a clear, cold voice.] Miss
Cardew is the grand-daughter of the late Mr. Thomas Cardew of 149 Belgrave
Square, S.W.; Gervase Park, Dorking, Surrey; and the Sporran, Fifeshire, N.B.
</p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  That sounds not unsatisfactory. Three addresses
    always inspire confidence, even in tradesmen. But what proof have I of their
    authenticity? </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> I have carefully preserved the
Court Guides of the period. They are open to your inspection, Lady Bracknell.
</p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  [Grimly.] I have known strange errors in that
    publication. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Miss Cardew's family solicitors
are Messrs. Markby, Markby, and Markby. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  Markby, Markby, and Markby? A firm of the very
    highest position in their profession. Indeed I am told that one of the Mr.
    Markby's is occasionally to be seen at dinner parties. So far I am
    satisfied. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> [Very irritably.] How extremely
kind of you, Lady Bracknell! I have also in my possession, you will be pleased
to hear, certificates of Miss Cardew's birth, baptism, whooping cough,
registration, vaccination, confirmation, and the measles; both the German and
the English variety. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  Ah! A life crowded with incident, I see; though
    perhaps somewhat too exciting for a young girl. I am not myself in favour of
    premature experiences. [Rises, looks at her watch.] Gwendolen! the time
    approaches for our departure. We have not a moment to lose. As a matter of
    form, Mr. Worthing, I had better ask you if Miss Cardew has any little
    fortune? </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Oh! about a hundred and thirty
thousand pounds in the Funds. That is all. Goodbye, Lady Bracknell. So pleased
to have seen you. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  [Sitting down again.] A moment, Mr. Worthing. A
    hundred and thirty thousand pounds! And in the Funds! Miss Cardew seems to
    me a most attractive young lady, now that I look at her. Few girls of the
    present day have any really solid qualities, any of the qualities that last,
    and improve with time. We live, I regret to say, in an age of surfaces. [To
    <b>Cecily</b>.] Come over here, dear. [<b>Cecily</b> goes across.] Pretty
    child! your dress is sadly simple, and your hair seems almost as Nature
    might have left it. But we can soon alter all that. A thoroughly experienced
    French maid produces a really marvellous result in a very brief space of
    time. I remember recommending one to young Lady Lancing, and after three
    months her own husband did not know her. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> And after six months nobody knew
her. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  [Glares at <b>Jack</b> for a few moments. Then
    bends, with a practised smile, to <b>Cecily</b>.] Kindly turn round, sweet
    child. [<b>Cecily</b> turns completely round.] No, the side view is what I
    want. [<b>Cecily</b> presents her profile.] Yes, quite as I expected. There
    are distinct social possibilities in your profile. The two weak points in
    our age are its want of principle and its want of profile. The chin a little
    higher, dear. Style largely depends on the way the chin is worn. They are
    worn very high, just at present. Algernon! </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Yes, Aunt Augusta! </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  There are distinct social possibilities in Miss
    Cardew's profile. </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Cecily is the sweetest,
    dearest, prettiest girl in the whole world. And I don't care twopence about
    social possibilities. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  Never speak disrespectfully of Society, Algernon.
    Only people who can't get into it do that. [To <b>Cecily</b>.] Dear child,
    of course you know that Algernon has nothing but his debts to depend upon.
    But I do not approve of mercenary marriages. When I married Lord Bracknell I
    had no fortune of any kind. But I never dreamed for a moment of allowing
    that to stand in my way. Well, I suppose I must give my consent. </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Thank you, Aunt Augusta.
    </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  Cecily, you may kiss me! </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> [Kisses her.] Thank you, Lady Bracknell. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  You may also address me as Aunt Augusta for the
    future. </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Thank you, Aunt Augusta. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  The marriage, I think, had better take place quite
    soon. </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Thank you, Aunt Augusta.
    </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Thank you, Aunt Augusta. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  To speak frankly, I am not in favour of long
    engagements. They give people the opportunity of finding out each other's
    character before marriage, which I think is never advisable. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> I beg your pardon for interrupting
you, Lady Bracknell, but this engagement is quite out of the question. I am Miss
Cardew's guardian, and she cannot marry without my consent until she comes of
age. That consent I absolutely decline to give. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  Upon what grounds may I ask? Algernon is an
    extremely, I may almost say an ostentatiously, eligible young man. He has
    nothing, but he looks everything. What more can one desire? </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> It pains me very much to have to
speak frankly to you, Lady Bracknell, about your nephew, but the fact is that I
do not approve at all of his moral character. I suspect him of being untruthful.
[<b>Algernon</b> and <b>Cecily</b> look at him in indignant amazement.] </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  Untruthful! My nephew Algernon? Impossible! He is
    an Oxonian. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> I fear there can be no possible
doubt about the matter. This afternoon during my temporary absence in London on
an important question of romance, he obtained admission to my house by means of
the false pretence of being my brother. Under an assumed name he drank, I've
just been informed by my butler, an entire pint bottle of my Perrier-Jouet,
Brut, '89; wine I was specially reserving for myself. Continuing his disgraceful
deception, he succeeded in the course of the afternoon in alienating the
affections of my only ward. He subsequently stayed to tea, and devoured every
single muffin. And what makes his conduct all the more heartless is, that he was
perfectly well aware from the first that I have no brother, that I never had a
brother, and that I don't intend to have a brother, not even of any kind. I
distinctly told him so myself yesterday afternoon. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  Ahem! Mr. Worthing, after careful consideration I
    have decided entirely to overlook my nephew's conduct to you. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> That is very generous of you, Lady
Bracknell. My own decision, however, is unalterable. I decline to give my
consent. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  [To <b>Cecily</b>.] Come here, sweet child.
    [<b>Cecily</b> goes over.] How old are you, dear? </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Well, I am really only eighteen, but I always admit to
    twenty when I go to evening parties. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  You are perfectly right in making some slight
    alteration. Indeed, no woman should ever be quite accurate about her age. It
    looks so calculating . . . [In a meditative manner.] Eighteen, but admitting
    to twenty at evening parties. Well, it will not be very long before you are
    of age and free from the restraints of tutelage. So I don't think your
    guardian's consent is, after all, a matter of any importance. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Pray excuse me, Lady Bracknell,
for interrupting you again, but it is only fair to tell you that according to
the terms of her grandfather's will Miss Cardew does not come legally of age
till she is thirty-five. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  That does not seem to me to be a grave objection.
    Thirty-five is a very attractive age. London society is full of women of the
    very highest birth who have, of their own free choice, remained thirty-five
    for years. Lady Dumbleton is an instance in point. To my own knowledge she
    has been thirty-five ever since she arrived at the age of forty, which was
    many years ago now. I see no reason why our dear Cecily should not be even
    still more attractive at the age you mention than she is at present. There
    will be a large accumulation of property. </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Algy, could you wait for me till I was thirty-five? </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Of course I could, Cecily.
    You know I could. </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Yes, I felt it instinctively, but I couldn't wait all that
    time. I hate waiting even five minutes for anybody. It always makes me
    rather cross. I am not punctual myself, I know, but I do like punctuality in
    others, and waiting, even to be married, is quite out of the question. </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Then what is to be done,
    Cecily? </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> I don't know, Mr. Moncrieff. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  My dear Mr. Worthing, as Miss Cardew states
    positively that she cannot wait till she is thirty-five—a remark which I am
    bound to say seems to me to show a somewhat impatient nature—I would beg of
    you to reconsider your decision. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> But my dear Lady Bracknell, the
matter is entirely in your own hands. The moment you consent to my marriage with
Gwendolen, I will most gladly allow your nephew to form an alliance with my
ward. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  [Rising and drawing herself up.] You must be quite
    aware that what you propose is out of the question. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Then a passionate celibacy is all
that any of us can look forward to. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  That is not the destiny I propose for Gwendolen.
    Algernon, of course, can choose for himself. [Pulls out her watch.] Come,
    dear, [<b>Gwendolen</b> rises] we have already missed five, if not six,
    trains. To miss any more might expose us to comment on the platform. </p>

<p>[Enter <b>Dr. Chasuble</b>.] </p>

<sp who="#chas"><speaker>CHASUBLE.</speaker> <p> Everything is quite ready for the christenings. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  The christenings, sir! Is not that somewhat
    premature? </p>

<sp who="#chas"><speaker>CHASUBLE.</speaker> <p> [Looking rather puzzled, and pointing to <b>Jack</b> and
    <b>Algernon</b>.] Both these gentlemen have expressed a desire for immediate
    baptism. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  At their age? The idea is grotesque and
    irreligious! Algernon, I forbid you to be baptized. I will not hear of such
    excesses. Lord Bracknell would be highly displeased if he learned that that
    was the way in which you wasted your time and money. </p>

<sp who="#chas"><speaker>CHASUBLE.</speaker> <p> Am I to understand then that there are to be no
    christenings at all this afternoon? </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> I don't think that, as things are
now, it would be of much practical value to either of us, Dr. Chasuble. </p>

<sp who="#chas"><speaker>CHASUBLE.</speaker> <p> I am grieved to hear such sentiments from you, Mr.
    Worthing. They savour of the heretical views of the Anabaptists, views that
    I have completely refuted in four of my unpublished sermons. However, as
    your present mood seems to be one peculiarly secular, I will return to the
    church at once. Indeed, I have just been informed by the pew-opener that for
    the last hour and a half Miss Prism has been waiting for me in the vestry.
    </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  [Starting.] Miss Prism! Did I hear you mention a
    Miss Prism? </p>

<sp who="#chas"><speaker>CHASUBLE.</speaker> <p> Yes, Lady Bracknell. I am on my way to join her. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  Pray allow me to detain you for a moment. This
    matter may prove to be one of vital importance to Lord Bracknell and myself.
    Is this Miss Prism a female of repellent aspect, remotely connected with
    education? </p>

<sp who="#chas"><speaker>CHASUBLE.</speaker> <p> [Somewhat indignantly.] She is the most cultivated of
    ladies, and the very picture of respectability. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  It is obviously the same person. May I ask what
    position she holds in your household? </p>

<sp who="#chas"><speaker>CHASUBLE.</speaker> <p> [Severely.] I am a celibate, madam. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> [Interposing.] Miss Prism, Lady
Bracknell, has been for the last three years Miss Cardew's esteemed governess
and valued companion. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  In spite of what I hear of her, I must see her at
    once. Let her be sent for. </p>

<sp who="#chas"><speaker>CHASUBLE.</speaker> <p> [Looking off.] She approaches; she is nigh. </p>

<p>[Enter <b>Miss Prism</b> hurriedly.] </p>

<sp who="#prism"><speaker>MISS PRISM.</speaker> <p> I was told you expected me in the vestry, dear Canon. I
    have been waiting for you there for an hour and three-quarters. [Catches
    sight of <b>Lady Bracknell</b>, who has fixed her with a stony glare.
    <b>Miss Prism</b> grows pale and quails. She looks anxiously round as if
    desirous to escape.] </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  [In a severe, judicial voice.] Prism! [<b>Miss
    Prism</b> bows her head in shame.] Come here, Prism! [<b>Miss Prism</b>
    approaches in a humble manner.] Prism! Where is that baby? [General
    consternation. The <b>Canon</b> starts back in horror. <b>Algernon</b> and
    <b>Jack</b> pretend to be anxious to shield <b>Cecily</b> and
    <b>Gwendolen</b> from hearing the details of a terrible public scandal.]
    Twenty-eight years ago, Prism, you left Lord Bracknell's house, Number 104,
    Upper Grosvenor Street, in charge of a perambulator that contained a baby of
    the male sex. You never returned. A few weeks later, through the elaborate
    investigations of the Metropolitan police, the perambulator was discovered
    at midnight, standing by itself in a remote corner of Bayswater. It
    contained the manuscript of a three-volume novel of more than usually
    revolting sentimentality. [<b>Miss Prism</b> starts in involuntary
    indignation.] But the baby was not there! [Every one looks at <b>Miss
    Prism</b>.] Prism! Where is that baby? [A pause.] </p>

<sp who="#prism"><speaker>MISS PRISM.</speaker> <p> Lady Bracknell, I admit with shame that I do not know.
    I only wish I did. The plain facts of the case are these. On the morning of
    the day you mention, a day that is for ever branded on my memory, I prepared
    as usual to take the baby out in its perambulator. I had also with me a
    somewhat old, but capacious hand-bag in which I had intended to place the
    manuscript of a work of fiction that I had written during my few unoccupied
    hours. In a moment of mental abstraction, for which I never can forgive
    myself, I deposited the manuscript in the basinette, and placed the baby in
    the hand-bag. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> [Who has been listening
attentively.] But where did you deposit the hand-bag? </p>

<sp who="#prism"><speaker>MISS PRISM.</speaker> <p> Do not ask me, Mr. Worthing. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Miss Prism, this is a matter of no
small importance to me. I insist on knowing where you deposited the hand-bag
that contained that infant. </p>

<sp who="#prism"><speaker>MISS PRISM.</speaker> <p> I left it in the cloak-room of one of the larger
    railway stations in London. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> What railway station? </p>

<sp who="#prism"><speaker>MISS PRISM.</speaker> <p> [Quite crushed.] Victoria. The Brighton line. [Sinks
    into a chair.] </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> I must retire to my room for a
moment. Gwendolen, wait here for me. </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  If you are not too long, I will wait here for you all my
    life. [Exit <b>Jack</b> in great excitement.] </p>

<sp who="#chas"><speaker>CHASUBLE.</speaker> <p> What do you think this means, Lady Bracknell? </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  I dare not even suspect, Dr. Chasuble. I need
    hardly tell you that in families of high position strange coincidences are
    not supposed to occur. They are hardly considered the thing. </p>

<p>[Noises heard overhead as if some one was throwing trunks about. Every
    one looks up.] </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> Uncle Jack seems strangely agitated. </p>

<sp who="#chas"><speaker>CHASUBLE.</speaker> <p> Your guardian has a very emotional nature. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  This noise is extremely unpleasant. It sounds as if
    he was having an argument. I dislike arguments of any kind. They are always
    vulgar, and often convincing. </p>

<sp who="#chas"><speaker>CHASUBLE.</speaker> <p> [Looking up.] It has stopped now. [The noise is
    redoubled.] </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  I wish he would arrive at some conclusion. </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  This suspense is terrible. I hope it will last. [Enter
    <b>Jack</b> with a hand-bag of black leather in his hand.] </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> [Rushing over to <b>Miss
Prism</b>.] Is this the hand-bag, Miss Prism? Examine it carefully before you
speak. The happiness of more than one life depends on your answer. </p>

<sp who="#prism"><speaker>MISS PRISM.</speaker> <p> [Calmly.] It seems to be mine. Yes, here is the injury
    it received through the upsetting of a Gower Street omnibus in younger and
    happier days. Here is the stain on the lining caused by the explosion of a
    temperance beverage, an incident that occurred at Leamington. And here, on
    the lock, are my initials. I had forgotten that in an extravagant mood I had
    had them placed there. The bag is undoubtedly mine. I am delighted to have
    it so unexpectedly restored to me. It has been a great inconvenience being
    without it all these years. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> [In a pathetic voice.] Miss Prism,
more is restored to you than this hand-bag. I was the baby you placed in it.
</p>

<sp who="#prism"><speaker>MISS PRISM.</speaker> <p> [Amazed.] You? </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> [Embracing her.] Yes . . . mother!
</p>

<sp who="#prism"><speaker>MISS PRISM.</speaker> <p> [Recoiling in indignant astonishment.] Mr. Worthing! I
    am unmarried! </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Unmarried! I do not deny that is a
serious blow. But after all, who has the right to cast a stone against one who
has suffered? Cannot repentance wipe out an act of folly? Why should there be
one law for men, and another for women? Mother, I forgive you. [Tries to embrace
her again.] </p>

<sp who="#prism"><speaker>MISS PRISM.</speaker> <p> [Still more indignant.] Mr. Worthing, there is some
    error. [Pointing to <b>Lady Bracknell</b>.] There is the lady who can tell
    you who you really are. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> [After a pause.] Lady Bracknell, I
hate to seem inquisitive, but would you kindly inform me who I am? </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  I am afraid that the news I have to give you will
    not altogether please you. You are the son of my poor sister, Mrs.
    Moncrieff, and consequently Algernon's elder brother. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Algy's elder brother! Then I have
a brother after all. I knew I had a brother! I always said I had a brother!
Cecily,—how could you have ever doubted that I had a brother? [Seizes hold of
<b>Algernon</b>.] Dr. Chasuble, my unfortunate brother. Miss Prism, my
unfortunate brother. Gwendolen, my unfortunate brother. Algy, you young
scoundrel, you will have to treat me with more respect in the future. You have
never behaved to me like a brother in all your life. </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Well, not till to-day, old
    boy, I admit. I did my best, however, though I was out of practice. </p>

<p>[Shakes hands.] </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  [To <b>Jack</b>.] My own! But what own are you? What is
    your Christian name, now that you have become some one else? </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Good heavens! . . . I had quite
forgotten that point. Your decision on the subject of my name is irrevocable, I
suppose? </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  I never change, except in my affections. </p>

<sp who="#ceci"><speaker>CECILY.</speaker> <p> What a noble nature you have, Gwendolen! </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Then the question had better be
cleared up at once. Aunt Augusta, a moment. At the time when Miss Prism left me
in the hand-bag, had I been christened already? </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  Every luxury that money could buy, including
    christening, had been lavished on you by your fond and doting parents. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Then I was christened! That is
settled. Now, what name was I given? Let me know the worst. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  Being the eldest son you were naturally christened
    after your father. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> [Irritably.] Yes, but what was my
father's Christian name? </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  [Meditatively.] I cannot at the present moment
    recall what the General's Christian name was. But I have no doubt he had
    one. He was eccentric, I admit. But only in later years. And that was the
    result of the Indian climate, and marriage, and indigestion, and other
    things of that kind. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Algy! Can't you recollect what our
father's Christian name was? </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> My dear boy, we were never
    even on speaking terms. He died before I was a year old. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> His name would appear in the Army
Lists of the period, I suppose, Aunt Augusta? </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  The General was essentially a man of peace, except
    in his domestic life. But I have no doubt his name would appear in any
    military directory. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> The Army Lists of the last forty
years are here. These delightful records should have been my constant study.
[Rushes to bookcase and tears the books out.] M. Generals . . . Mallam, Maxbohm,
Magley, what ghastly names they have—Markby, Migsby, Mobbs, Moncrieff!
Lieutenant 1840, Captain, Lieutenant-Colonel, Colonel, General 1869, Christian
names, Ernest John. [Puts book very quietly down and speaks quite calmly.] I
always told you, Gwendolen, my name was Ernest, didn't I? Well, it is Ernest
after all. I mean it naturally is Ernest. </p>

       <sp who="#brack"><speaker>LADY BRACKNELL.</speaker> <p>  Yes, I remember now that the General was called
    Ernest, I knew I had some particular reason for disliking the name. </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  Ernest! My own Ernest! I felt from the first that you
    could have no other name! </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Gwendolen, it is a terrible thing
for a man to find out suddenly that all his life he has been speaking nothing
but the truth. Can you forgive me? </p>

       <sp who="#gwen"><speaker>GWENDOLEN.</speaker>  I can. For I feel that you are sure to change. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> My own one! </p>

<sp who="#chas"><speaker>CHASUBLE.</speaker> <p> [To <b>Miss Prism</b>.] Lætitia! [Embraces her] </p>

<sp who="#prism"><speaker>MISS PRISM.</speaker> <p> [Enthusiastically.] Frederick! At last! </p>

<sp who="#alg"> <speaker>ALGERNON.</speaker> <p> Cecily! [Embraces her.] At
    last! </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> Gwendolen! [Embraces her.] At
last! </p>

<pLADY BRACKNELL.<br /> My nephew, you seem to be displaying signs of
    triviality. </p>

<sp who="#jack"> <speaker>JACK.</speaker> <p> On the contrary, Aunt Augusta,
I've now realised for the first time in my life the vital Importance of Being
Earnest. </p>
